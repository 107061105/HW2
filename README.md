## I. Introduction

In this assignment, we will gengerate triangle waves, then send it to the picoscope and PC. By doing this, we can compare the difference between signal displayed on the picoscope, and the sampled signal.

## II. Implement

We need to contain following

### 1.Inputs
Add buttons on the bread board (as DigitalIn): up, down and select.
### 2.Display
Create a selection display on uLCD to select from a few frequencies by your choice, e.g., 100Hz, 200Hz, etc.
### 3.Generate waveform 
Use DAC to generate a wave form with the chosen frequency and pass the generated signal through a RC low pass filter.
### 4.Measure
Use Picoscope to measure the generated wave form.
### 5.Sample
Sample the generated wave form and send the value to PC/Python.
### 6.Analysis
Analyze the captured waveform: show frequency response and wave on screen with Matplotlib.

## III. Result
